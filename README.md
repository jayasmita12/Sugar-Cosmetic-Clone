# Introduction
We were trying to build An E-Commerce website for our Projects Of Masai. We have given a task to Replicate The SugarCosmetics.com Website Using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. We have used this skillset to build a responsiveness website as like SugarCosmetics and for the different screen sizes like Mobile, I pad & Large screens.

# How we Build the Project
We started the project with discussing how to Build It more responsive to the users as a real one .We came up with different ideas of putting all the functionalities of the website but in short-time we came to know that it takes more time .so we made it more as responsive for the users within our period of time of Five days. We were able to identify all the problem one shall face while building the project and had necessary guidelines in place which would help us move forward step by step rather than jumping and opening many things at a time.

# Outcomes
To be able to work on a project the team members must possess leadership qualities, he/she should be able to contribute ideas and be respectful to others.
Overall, it was a surreal experience, and we look forward to many such challenges.
